This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the initial home page.

Or visit the deployed application by [clicking here](I will add when it's done)


## üíª About the project

- You can check the [Back End project here](https://github.com/Breno-MT/Crypto_Wallet_BackEnd) üêç
- Which will contain a different README with my thoughts as well üôÇ


This project has a purpose to utilize as my main source of proof that I know how to program and show my thought of processing the ideas, challenges that I have encountered and still can encounter as a programmer myself. And to be honest, since I've been working in the web development for quite some time right now this was a piece of cake, and It is a very but very simple project that I hope some beginner programmer can learn from. Of course it doesn't mean that I have encountered walls along the way.

I choose the crypto idea because I always thought that crypto was fantastic and I wanted to make something related to that. I saw a lot of simple projects that let you select the crypto and that's it, I wanted to created a full custom page just for the user itself to utilize to it's maximum and maybe integrate on his life, but as I said before I'm this as a theme and not as a solution, so other websites definely cover this idea better than me.

As you navigate through the project you will see various practices that I put effort in making this project to close as possible to a real product.

Which means that I tried my best to emulate a real-life production software.

You can see that I organized all the files inside folders, for each component there's his specific folder inside src/components/name_of_the_component/ComponentName.js and then I call that component inside the src/pages/ which are basically the entire route system.
This means that I tried to follow a pattern in my project that I can globally understand where to find things that I need and exclude the need of creating something every time I have to create a new screen or whatever is the case.

With that in mind, know that I tried to make this "simple" project as readable as possible for any kind of level (probably seniors will find more exploits or things to improve, I will get in that level as well... ü•≤) so you shouldn't have any problem on understanding the login flow, registering flow etc etc

I utilized a lot of env variables from the .env_local etc etc, so don't be surprised to see something "missing".

And I used Page Router instead of App Router for personal reasons (I can work with App Router as well).

This project is a way of expressing some knowledge that I gained during my period of programmer, and a way to teach new people on how to use clean code, MVC etc etc

Things that are necessary for every programmer to learn while they evolve during their process. And of course you should use Stack Overflow, forums, read books regarding the programming area, I don't recommend ChatGPT if you're a beginner because you need to learn first on how to filter information and know if that information is good or bad, 80% of the time ChatGPT will troll you hard, very hard, beware of that.

If you're a beginner yourself and found this project, feel free to fail a lot and don't understand nothing, it's complete normal. The more you fail the more you become better (Dark Souls mentality, like... literally.)
And allow yourself to feel frustation, sadness and anger when something doesn't goes your way. Understand that it's part of the process and you have to deal with it anyways. Try to be strong emotionally as possible since every decision you make can affect a lot of things and people.

While I was programming this project I used trello for personal thought process and analyze of the problems and features that I wanted to implement or cover it.

I think this project opened my mind to a lot of ideas that I can create, It truly helped to think more instead of just vibe coding and hopefully cross fingers that something will work out of nowhere.


Of course, this project probably will or will not receive updates, which means that It's just my playground and you can fork it and make yours as well, just will have to adjust it to suit better for yourself.

Well, feel free to open any Issues regarding questions or improvements that you want to talk about it or implement on this project.

If the timeline of this long long essay feels strange, I wroted this at 5am.
